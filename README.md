# polyrhythm-generator
Webpage that generates tables for counting polyrhythms. Written in HTML, CSS, and JS. Uses a little math.js, but a version without is available.

## Current features:
+ Pulse/Counterpulse input
+ Resolve value (the number of beats until both pulses happen on the same beat)
+ Table w/ accents

## Planned Features:
+ [ ] Divided line segments (for [polyrhythmic juggling, baby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEPu8rEYQJY))
  + Currently in development ([go to branch](https://github.com/bustinbung/polyrhythm-generator/tree/lines))
+ [ ] Quick counting for faster polyrhythms (like 1 2 3 41 for 7:11)
+ [ ] Known counting phrases ("pass the godd*** butter" for 4:3 or "nice cup of tea" for 3:2)
