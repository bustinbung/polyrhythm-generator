# polyrhythm-generator
Webpage that generates tables for counting polyrhythms. Written in HTML, CSS, and JS. Hosted [here](https://bustinbung.github.io/polyrhythm-generator).

## Current features:
+ Pulse/Counterpulse input
+ Resolve value (the number of beats until both pulses happen on the same beat)
+ Table w/ accents
+ Divided line segments (for [polyrhythmic juggling, baby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEPu8rEYQJY))

## Planned Features:
+ [ ] Responsive design (yay mobile!)
+ [ ] Quick counting for faster polyrhythms (like 1 2 3 41 for 7:11)
+ [ ] Known counting phrases ("pass the godd*** butter" for 4:3 or "nice cup of tea" for 3:2)
